# stroke_predict_LogRec_RandForClasifier_SVC
Making predictions on stroke possibility using three models and comparing the results: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Machine.

Project Description The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict house prices based on their characteristics. The House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques dataset from Kaggle was used for this.

Technologies Used Python Pandas, Numpy (data processing) Matplotlib, Seaborn (data visualization) Scikit-learn (machine learning)

**Execution Steps

Problem Statement:** Predict house prices. Use numeric and categorical features such as house area, number of rooms, year of construction, etc. 2. Data Download and Exploration: Data was downloaded from Kaggle. Data structure, missing values, and descriptive statistics were analyzed. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Missing values ​​were checked. Target variable (house prices) was analyzed. Correlation of features with house price was analyzed. Data preprocessing: Missing values ​​of numerical features were replaced with the median. Missing values ​​of categorical features were replaced with the most frequent values. Categorical features were transformed using OneHotEncoder. Model training: The GradientBoostingRegressor model was trained. The model was evaluated using the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) metric. Results visualization: Comparison of predicted prices with real values. Preparing the file for Kaggle: A file with predictions was created for submission to the Kaggle platform.
Results The Gradient Boosting model showed good prediction accuracy with a minimum mean absolute error (MAE). Visualization showed a strong correlation between real and predicted values.
